## Configuration

### Enabling/Disabling bridges

By default, the script creates `whitelist.txt` and adds the main bridges (see above). you can edit it:

 * to enable extra bridges (one bridge per line)
 * to disable main bridges (remove the line)
 * to enable all bridges (just one wildcard `*` as file content)

As a matter  of simplicity, this YunoHost package enables every bridge by default.

#### Multi-users support

This is application is public and there's no notion of user.
